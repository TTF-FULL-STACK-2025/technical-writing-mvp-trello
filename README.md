This repository contains the backend implementation for a Trello- styled web-based kanban application.

This project is part of a school assignment focused on the production of clear and maintainable technical documentation, API design, and collaborative development workflows.  
The backend exposes a REST API in Python and includes auto-generated documentation via OpenAPI/Swagger.
## Documentation
Full project documentation is available in the `/docs` folder:
 - **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** – overall product scope and requirements
 - **Functional Analysis**
 - **Technical Analysis / Architecture**
Links are to be added when available.
## Project Summary

The MVP includes user accounts, boards, lists, cards, role management, and activity logging.

The backend is designed to be:
 - API-first
 - Scalable and maintainable
 - Fully documented through OpenAPI
 - Extensible for future frontends (web/mobile)
For the full feature list, refer to the PRD in `/docs`.
## Project Goals
